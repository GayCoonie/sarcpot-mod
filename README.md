# Sarcpot - A Balatro mod for the girls, gays and indie game fans

Sarcpot is a mod where i'm adding anything i want really. Will release it once i have a larger number of implemented content.

For now there are **11** implemented jokers and **2** vouchers with more to come! I plan on making jokers based on some of my niche interests and hyperfixations soon!

(am amateur coder and artist, very tiny and dumb, please be nice to me somewhat(plz))
